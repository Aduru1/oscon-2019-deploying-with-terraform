## In this session...

* Live-deploy containerized and serverless apps with Terraform.
* Working locally with [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) and
  [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com).

All of the Terraform features I'll demonstrate applies just as well to the
different cloud providers and their managed services.
